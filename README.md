1. Is there provision for restoring access to entities that have forgotten their passwords?
2. Could we also consider adding an entity’s LOGO or Profile picture?
3. What formats are accepted for attached documents?
4. Would it be easier to have them make payment online (through VISA or Mobile Money) as opposed to submitting a receipt?

6. It might also be easier for the admin user to send a note/message directly to the applicant’s email. In case there is something wrong with their application. Or something to clarify.
